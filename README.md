TASK-04:TIC-TAC-TOE GAME
Excited to share one of the projects I completed during my internship at Prodigy Infotech 🎉
I developed a fully functional Tic Tac Toe Web Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, game logic implementation, event handling, and responsive UI design.
✨ Key Features:
Interactive 2-player gameplay
Real-time win detection
Score tracking system
Restart/New Game functionality
Clean and user-friendly interface
Building this project enhanced my problem-solving skills and gave me practical experience in front-end development.
Grateful to Prodigy Infotech for the opportunity to learn and grow! 🚀
